\section{Experience and Recommendations}\label{sec:intro}
Our overall experience in this project was very positive. We gained many new skills related to embedded systems, programming, and mechatronics. 

Although we consider the conveyor system to he well-designed and robust, some improvements could be made with the sensors. The sensors sometimes provided incorrect readings even after using low-pass filters. With regards to the whole lab-experience, we have no recommendations. All labs and milestones were well-designed to allow students to learn effectively.
