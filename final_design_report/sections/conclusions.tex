\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The final design of the inspection system successfully met all the requirements set for the project. All the 48 pieces were sorted in 45 seconds without any errors. The system pause function and system ramp-down functions were successfully demonstrated. Also, all the details of items sorted and items remaining on the belt were displayed correctly on the LCD display.

The design of this embedded system was very challenging and at the same time highly rewarding. The project demanded the use of advanced programming skills and a very good knowledge of microcontrollers. The whole course was so well designed that every day we learned something new which helped us to complete the project.

The confidence that the successful demonstration of this project gave us was enormous. We got a chance to learn about the microcontroller architecture, Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Interrupts, Timers, implementation of a linked list in C using pointers, various sensors, and actuators. We are confident that we have learned enough from this course on how to interface between sensors, actuators, and MCU and on how to configure MCU registers for using the various functionalities, to take up more challenging tasks using microcontrollers. The most impressive aspect of this project was learning tonnes of new things by doing something very interesting and fun.
