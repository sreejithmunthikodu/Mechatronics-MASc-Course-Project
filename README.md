# Mechatronics-MASc-Course-Project
MASc Course Project, Design and Implementation of an Inspection System Using an ATMEL AVR Microcontroller, University of Victoria, Winter 2018

Modern embedded systems have become a vital part of our daily life with their applications ranging from
portable devices such as digital watches and digital cameras to large and complex installations such as trac
lights, washing machines, and automotive systems. The objective of this design project was to design a high-
performance inspection system, implement the proposed design using an ATMEL AVR microcontroller and to
demonstrate it's functionality. The inspection system was required to sort given number of items based on the
visual and material characteristics in a minimum amount of time. The project required to use the advanced
microcontroller functionalities such as Interrupts, Timers, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Analog to
Digital Converters (ADC). Also, advanced programming skills were required to implement functions such as
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) dynamic linked list using C-language. Moreover, the project demanded using various
sensors such as inductance and re
ectance sensors, and actuators such as a DC motor to drive the conveyor
belt and a stepper motor to rotate the bin to collect the sorted items.
